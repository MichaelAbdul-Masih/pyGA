!                   new hydro, cmf, number of bugs corrected
!
!     version: 1.1  july 10th 1996
!                   modified for mixed cmf/sa ,
!                   outer boundary (sa-lines),

!                   if itlast.ne.0
!
!                   !!! note that due to a slightly different updating
!                       of xlevel = (ni/nk)*, minor differences in
!                       the occupation numbers will arise if one
!                       compares the results of a calculation with
!                       and without an interupt!!!

!                   to the requirements specified in subroutine
!                   cmfprep. this possibility is used if the parameter
!                   optmixed in the input (the former parameter df,
!                   which has no meaning any longer) is set to unity.
!                   if all lines are to be treated in the cmf, optmixed

!                   update of electron density for ni* (in netmat,
!                   coll. terms) forgotten. inconsistent treatment of
!                   gaunt-factor in opacity (all freq.) and photo-
!                   integrals (only at edge) leads to inappropriate alo.

!                    with WM-basic); Restart capabilities not tested so far  
!                    used only by Jo.
!
!     version: 7.4   june 2003: Vers. 7.2.2 and 7.3 coupled
!     version: 8.0   july 1st 2003: most important metals now "exactly treated, &
!                    T-correction from corresponding transitions 
!                    needs nlte_approx Vers. 5.0, 
!                    (-> new atomic data file-path: ATOMDAT_NEW!)

!     version: 8.1   july 30th: small changes after testing for Bstars;
!                    most important changes: check for TAURLIM and increase
!                    if strong winds; imin, imax for Si.
!                    check also for TMIN1 in module tcorr_var!
!  
!     version: 8.2   inclusion of approximate treatment of clumping
!                    different layout of INDAT.DAT required
!                    use nlte_approx version 5.1 and higher
!  
!                    NOTE1: ne, nh and occup. numbers include enhancement-factor,
!                          opacities are corrected
!                          (except FFOPA, which is needed only for T-structure)
!                          to account for spatial averages in RT calculations. 
!                          PAY ATTENTION if line processes are considered, &
!                          particularly in SA, and
!                          whenever local opacities are needed
!                    WARNING: since the energy balance is calculated inside
!                          the clumps (alternative argument: enhancement-factor
!                          cancels out), pay attention if adiabatic cooling is
!                          included, since then the rates MUST be corrected!
!                    NOTE2: not rigorously tested so far. Use at own risk!
!  
!     version: 8.3   changes in INTERMEPHO (calculate heating/cooling rates
!                    without ALO)
!                    XNE -> XNELTE whenever LTE values are used
!                    (to clarify programming)
!                    heating/cooling rates of explicit elements calculated
!                    with NEW occupation numbers (which is more consistent)
!                    START of Sobolev Treatment from it = 4 on!
!
!     version: 8.3.1 improvement of T-convergence, hundreds of tests
!
!     version: 8.3.2 May 2004 
!                    inclusion of DELPARA in calculation of hydro-structure
!                    to account for deviations from power-law in case of
!                    cool stars (Teff < 12000). Now the actual and used
!                    opacities should agree perfectly.  
!                    Note that in this case vdiv is NOT updated, &
!                    thus density inversions are possible. 
!                    Bug in logic concerning OPTNEUPDATE=.FALSE. and T-corr
!                    removed. Ne is now updated to actual LTE density.  
!                    New hack in the calculation of T(hydro). If Tact
!                    is still Tmin, dT is set to zero. This improves the
!                    consistency between Tact and Thydro significantly.
!                    The deviation between both (-> FASTWIND.LOG) should be
!                    now of order of 1%.  
!
!     version: 8.4   August 2004                    
!                    inclusion of formula 46 plus function prhcol
!                    (n, np, z, e), as referred to by
!                      Przybilla and Butler, A&A 2004.
!                    New formula 113 (old H-coll, cf. Burke et al. 1967), 
!                      corresponds to the data given in A10HHe if the
!                      modification as outlined by formula 13 (see below)
!                      should NOT be applied.
!                    This version is applicable to both the optical and the
!                    infrared provided that the correct DETAIL DATASET
!                       is taken; i.e., either
!                    A10HHe (old H-coll. data from Giovanardi et al., &
!                            subr. hcol, formula 13)
!                       or
!                    A11HHe (new H-coll. data from Butler, see above)  
!
!     version: 8.5   Nov. 2004
!                    change in calculation of dqdt partials for explicit
!                    elements to be consistent with nlte_approx.
!                    smaller changes in treatment of inverted levels
!
!                    changes in frescal and fresfin to resolve H and HeI
!                    resonance lines  
!
!     version: 8.5.1 April 2005: Bug in Tratcol (formula 113) identified
!
!     version: 8.5.2 Sept. 2005: Rel diff in cooling changed: at first
!                    differences > 1e-3 are checked, then differences > 1e-4 
!                    abundance changes for explicit and background elements
!                    now from INDAT.DAT (see comments around line 870 and docu.txt
!                    NEW solar abundances from file abundances_solar
!
!     version: 8.6   Oct. 2005: Careful tests concerning clumping performed;
!                    no programming error in original approach from
!                    version 8.2 detected.
!                    Input of clumping-parameters generalized:
!                    Variable number of parameters (up to ten) possible
!                    (e.g., if user changes stratification in subroutine clumping)
!                     parameters now contained in allocated field clf_field) 
!
!                    IMPORTANT: first parameter has to be REPRESENTATIVE
!                    clumping factor which will be ONLY used to find
!                    appropriate HOPF-parameters for calculating the
!                    T-structure in the start-model.
!
!                Correspondance with old approach:  
!
!                clf_field(1)=clf, clf_field(2)=vclstart, clf_field(3)=vclmax 
!
!     version: 8.6.1 Oct. 2005: distribution of radial points changed, 
!                    to better sample the transonic region (for IR!)
!                    xnh precision in GROUND1 changed, to allow for restart
!                    with different (explicit) metal abundances
!
!     version: 8.6.2 Feb. 2006: formula 17 - CBF (needed, e.g., for ground
!                    state ionization of NIII) changed. Note that
!                    there was a bug in the old version!
!
!                    precision of inversion of pure continuum rate eq.

!
!     version: 8.7 March 2006: inclusion of Miguel's version 8.5.2_alpha
!                    treatment of the OP rbf data improved: a new
!		     subroutine (op_setup) takes care of the initial
!		     set up of the OP data. Minor modifications to account for
!		     changes in the frequency grid (see LTE subroutine).
!                    It also checks for differences in the ionization energies 
!                    defined in the input DETAIL file and the OP energies, for
!                    consistency. 
!                    Bug detected and corrected in TRATCOL formula (26), so far 
!                    used only by CIII model atom.
!                    Bug in INTERMECOL formula (17) corrected (Achim),
!                    only affects NIII model atom, so far
!                    Integration limit DEX (subroutine INTERMEPHO) changed to
!                    allow for very detailed model atoms (mainly Norbert's neutral
!                    ions) that have levels with fairly similar energies.
!
!     version: 8.7.1 March 2006: smoothing of OP-DATA RBF cross-sections 
!
!     version: 9.0 March 2006: REQUIRES NEW nlte_type.f90
!                    new formualae for Adi's data set 
!                    completely new approach to calculate ILOW, IMAX
!                    new routines ilowimax_lte and ilowimax_nlte
!                    in case, update ONLY ILOWIMAX_NLTE (contained in nlte_approx.f90) 
!                    The old treatment (which is used also for z=0) is
!                    kept in routine ILOWIMAX_OLD (requires "old" detail files)
!                    Now, we make a division between
!                    ILOW, IMAX, IMIA, IMAA
!                    which refer to LTE values and define, e.g., the

!                    ILOWNL, IMAXNL, IMIANL, IMAANL
!                    which refer to NLTE values and are used to solve the 
!                    rate equations. For H and He, both quantities are
!                    identical and calculated in OCCLTE.
!                    Dimensions of xl, partit and occnum corrected.
!
!                    Note: z=0 treatment not checked so far
!
!                    default value for nd (id_ndepth) is now 51. One point
!                    close to photosphere (just below) included, to allow

!
!                    iterative improvement of solution of rate-equations
!                    calculated with residuum in qp precision 
!                    (possible with recent versions of intel compiler)
!
!     version: 9.1 August 2006: subr. ILOWIMAX_NLTE moved to nlte_approx in
!                    order to allow compilation from scratch (uses nlte_app) 
!                    VDIV allowed to INCREASE only (old "bug")

PROGRAM FASTWIND
!
!-----this program will - hopefully - solve the nlte line-formation
!-----problem for unified atmospheres in an optimum  way
!
!
!     program can be used now for calculation of hydrogen and helium,
!     silicon, magnesium, C, N, O (DETAIL versions) 
!
!     and for all elements with Adi's data (if you have a corresponding
!     input file). Note, however, that using elements with a large
!     line number is inconsistent with present assumptions
!
!     developing/programming: j.puls, e. santolaya-rey (version 0.0), &
!                             miguel a. urbaneja (tcorr and more ions, &
!                             version 7.2.1)   
!
!     You can include own clumping laws by manipulating subroutine
!     clumping (max. number of parameters: 10)  
!
!     note: if new atoms are implemented, provide new formulae in
!           subroutines crossbf (photo cross sections),
!                       intermecol (coll. cross sections (ionisation))
!                   and tratcol (coll. excitation)
!           if necessary!!!
!           also required is update of ilow, imax in routine ilowimax 
!           (_old, _lte, _nlte (latter in nlte_approx.f90))
!
!
!     missing points at present:
!
!   i)calculating taur(nlte)
!  ii)updating of hydro-structure with respect to tau'(nlte)
! iii)(overlapping) lines included in continuum and ionization integrals 
!     maybe important at edges
!  iv) external photospheric structures only for unclumped models
!
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!
!
!-----this program uses three values for the stellar radius:
!--   1) the input value rstar, which is the nominal radius where
!--      tau(-lucy) = 2/3; note that log g  and teff are
!--      also defined with respect to this radius. srnom = rstar * rsun.
!--   2) the lowest value of r(nd) = sr < srnom which is the scaling
!--      radius of the poblem.
!--   3) the radius where the beta-field and the photosphere merge
!--      ("transition point"): srvmin
!--
!--   rtau23 is the ratio of srnom/sr
!--
!
! WARNING!!! program nlte uses

!  abund = n(k)/n(H), i.e. normalized to hyd.

!            program nlte_approx uses   
!  abund = n(k)/Sum(n(k)), i.e. normalized to ntot
!
! Thus, also the value of summass = Sum(abund(i)) in both cases differ!!!

!---- this subroutine interpolates h and n to get points on the r-grid
!---- changed (26/3/93) so that negative fluxes does not affect the
!---- logarithmic interpolation
!----
!---- comment from jo: this is an elegant, but not very exact way,
!---- since it is more appropriate for linear interpolation. however,
!---- since log (c*r^n + desh) = log(c'*r^n) with c' = c + desh*r^(-n),
!---- the real assumption underlying this approach is that c' instead
!---- of c is constant over the considered interval. this is not too
!---- bad and was checked by myself that it works fairly well.

subroutine conv_spec (sx,sy,py,n)

! note1:
! in contrast to the idl routine (convol.pro), we wrap the response function
! around zero, to enable padding in a simple way.
! This is necessary here since we deal with functions which are completely
! non-periodical (s(1) and s(N) have completely different orders),
! in contrast to convolving rectified spectra which begin and end at unity.
!
! note2:
! this routine uses the "slow" way. By exploiting the fact that
! signal and response are real functions, one could save a factor of
! roughly two. Since the convolution(s) have to be done only once per
! frequ. grid, we use here the "standard" way for clarity.
