 NAME:
	ADSTRING
 PURPOSE:
	Return RA and Dec as character string in sexigesimal format.
	RA and Dec may be entered as either a 2 element vector or as
	2 scalars.  One can also specify the precision of the declination
	in digits after the decimal point.

 CALLING SEQUENCE
	result = ADSTRING( ra_dec )	      
		or
	result = ADSTRING( ra,dec,[ precision ] )

 INPUTS:
	RA_DEC - 2 element vector giving the right ascension and declination
		in decimal degrees.
                     or
	RA     - Right ascension in decimal degrees, numeric scalar
	DEC    - Declination in decimal degrees, numeric scalar

 OPTIONAL INPUT:
	PRECISION  - The number of digits after the decimal of DEClination.
		The RA is automatically 1 digit more.  This parameter may 
		either be the third parameter after RA,DEC or the second 
		parameter after [RA,DEC].  It is not available for just DEC.  
		If no PRECISION parameter is passed, a precision of 1 for 
		both RA and DEC is returned to maintain compatibility with 
		past ADSTRING functions.  A precision of 0 will result in 
		the below format, always claimed, but but never delivered by 
		ADSTRING.
  KEYWORD:  
       zero:  if set then seconds are zero padded.

 OUTPUT:
	RESULT - Character string containing HR,MIN,SEC,DEC,MIN,SEC formatted
		as ( 2I3,F5.(p+1),2I3,F4.p ) where p is the PRECISION 
		parameter.    If only a single scalar is supplied it is 
		converted to a sexigesimal string (2I3,F5.1).

 EXAMPLE:
	(1) Display CRVAL coordinates in a FITS header, H

	IDL> crval = sxpar(h,'CRVAL*')  ;Extract 2 element CRVAL vector (degs)
	IDL> print, adstring(crval)     ;Print CRVAL vector sexigesimal format

	(2)  print,adstring(30.42,-1.23,1)  ==>  ' 02 01 40.80  -01 13 48.0'
	     print,adstring(30.42,+0.23)    ==>  ' 02 01 40.8  +00 13 48.0'
	     print,adstring(+0.23)          ==>  '+00 13 48.0'

 PROCEDURES CALLED:
	RADEC, SIXTY()

 REVISION HISTORY:
	Written   W. Landsman                      June 1988
	Addition of variable precision and DEC seconds precision fix. 
	ver.  Aug. 1990 [E. Deutsch]
	Output formatting spiffed up       October 1991 [W. Landsman]
	Remove ZPARCHECK call, accept 1 element vector  April 1992 [W. Landsman]
	Call ROUND() instead of NINT()    February 1996  [W. Landsman]
 Appropriate roundoff added for RA (Seb Oliver 4th March 1997)
 ZERO keyword added to allow zero padding on seconds (Seb Oliver 4th March 1997)

 NAME:	
	DBFIND()
 PURPOSE:	
	Search data base for entries with specified characteristics

 CALLING SEQUENCE:	
	result = dbfind(spar,[ listin, /SILENT, /FULLSTRING])

 INPUTS:	
	spar - search_parameters (string)...each search parameter 
		is of the form:

		option 1) min_val < item_name < max_val
		option 2) item_name = value
		option 3) item_name = [value_1, value_10]
			Note: option 3 is also the slowest.
		option 4) item_name > value
		option 5) item_name < value
		option 6) item_name = value(tolerance) ;eg. temp=25.0(5.2)
		option 7) item_name			;must be non-zero

 		Multiple search parameters are separated by a comma.
		eg.     'cam_no=2,14<ra<20'

		Note: < is interpreted as less than or equal.
		      > is interpreted as greater than or equal.
	
		RA and DEC keyfields are stored as floating point numbers 
		in the data base may be entered as HH:MM:SEC and
		DEG:MIN:SEC. Where:

			HH:MM:SEC   equals  HH + MM/60.0  + SEC/3600.
			DEG:MIN:SEC equals DEG + MIN/60.0 + SEC/3600.
			
		For example:
			40:34:10.5 < dec < 43:25:19 , 8:22:1.0 < ra < 8:23:23.0

		Specially encoded date/time in the data base may
		be entered by  YY/DAY:hr:min:sec which is
		interpreted as  
			YY*1000+DAY+hr/24.0+min/24.0/60.+sec/24.0/3600.

		For example
			85/201:10:35:30<date_time<85/302:10:33:33.4
		would specify all entries between:
			year 1985 day 201 at 10:35:30 to
			day 302 at 10:33:33.4
		The date/time may also be encoded as:
			DD-MMM-YEAR HH::MM:SS.SS	
			eg.  12-JUL-86 10:23:33.45
		(this is the format of system variable !stime)

		Multiple search parameters may be stored in a string
		array (one parameter per array element) instead of
		concatenating them with commas in a single string.
		Example:
			input_array = strarr(2)
			input_array(0) = '14<ra<16'   ; 14-16 hrs of ra.
			input_array(1) = '8<dec<20'   ; + 8-20 deg. decl.

 OPTIONAL INPUT:	
	listin - gives list of entries to be searched.  If not supplied or 
		set to -1 then all entries are searched.

 OUTPUT:	
	List of ENTRY numbers satisfying search characteristics
		is returned as the function value.

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORDS:	
	SILENT  - If the keyword SILENT is set and non-zero, then DBFIND
		will not print the number of entries found.

	FULLSTRING - By default, one has a match if a search string is 
		included in any part of a database value (substring match).   
		But if /FULLSTRING is set, then all characters in the database
		value must match the search string (excluding leading and 
		trailing blanks).    Both types of string searches are case
		insensitive.
 PROCEDURE CALLS:
 	DB_INFO(), DB_ITEM, DB_ITEM_INFO(), DBEXT, DBEXT_IND, DBFIND_ENTRY,
	DBFIND_SORT, DBFPARSE, DBRD, DBSEARCH, ZPARCHECK,IS_IEEE_BIG()

 OPERATIONAL NOTES:	
	The data base must be previously opened with DBOPEN.

 SIDE EFFECT:	
	!ERR is set to number of entries found

 NAME:
	DBOPEN
 PURPOSE:
	Routine to open an IDL database

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	dbopen, name, update

 INPUTS:
	name - (Optional) name or names of the data base files to open.
		It has one of the following forms:

		'name'		-open single data base file
		'name1,name2,...,nameN' - open N files which are
				connected via pointers.
		'name,*'	-Open the data base with all data
				bases connected via pointers
		''		-Interactively allow selection of
				the data base files.

		If not supplied then '' is assumed.
		name may optionally be a string array with one name
		per element.

	update - (Optional) Integer flag specifing openning for update.
		0 	- Open for read only
		1	- Open for update
		2	- Open index file for update only
		!PRIV must be 2 or greater to open a file for update.
		If a file is opened for update only a single data base
		can be specified.

 OUTPUTS:
	none

 KEYWORDS:
	UNAVAIL - If present, a "database doesn't exit" flag is returned
	          through it.  0 = the database exists and was opened (if
	          no other errors arose).  1 = the database doesn't exist.
	          Also if present, the error message for non-existent databases
	          is suppressed.  The action, however, remains the same.  If
	          specifiying this, be sure that the variable passed exists
	          before the call to DBOPEN.
 SIDE EFFECTS:
	The .DBF and .dbx files are opened using unit numbers obtained by
 	GET_LUN.  Descriptions of the files are placed in the common block
 	DB_COM.

 NAME:
	HASTROM
 PURPOSE:
	Linear transformation of an image to align with a reference image
 EXPLANATION:
	A linear transformation is applied to image so that   
	its astrometry is identical with that in a reference header.  This
	procedure can be used to align two images.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	HASTROM, oldim, oldhd, newim, newhd, refhd, [MISSING = , INTERP = ]
		or
	HASTROM, oldim, oldhd, refhd, [MISSING = , INTERP =, NGRID =  , CUBIC =]

 INPUTS:
	OLDIM - Image array to be manipulated.  If only 3 parameters are
		supplied then OLDIM and OLDHD will be modified to contain 
		the output image array and header
	OLDHD - FITS header array for OLDIM, containing astrometry parameters
	REFHD - Reference header, containing astrometry parameters.  OLDIM
		will be rotated, shifted, and compressed or expanded until
		its astrometry matches that in REFHD.
 OUTPUTS:
	NEWIM - Image array after linear tranformation has been performed.
		The dimensions of NEWIM will be identical to the NAXIS1 and 
		NAXIS2 keywords specified in REFHD.  Regions on the reference 
		image that do not exist in OLDIM can be assigned a value with
		the MISSING keyword.
	NEWHD - Updated FITS image header associated with NEWIM

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORDS:
	MISSING - Set this keyword to a scalar value which will be assigned
		to pixels in the output image which do not correspond to 
		existing imput images.  If not supplied then linear 
		extrapolation is used.   See the IDL manual on POLY_2D.
	INTERP - Scalar, one of -1, 1, or 2 determining type of interpolation
		-1 nearest neighbor, 1 (default) bilinear interpolation, 
		2 cubic interpolation.
	CUBIC - if set and nonzero, then cubic interpolation is used (equivalent
		to INTERP = 2.   In IDL V5.0 or later, the CUBIC parameter can
		also be set to a value between -1 and 0 (see poly_2d for info).
	NGRID -  Integer scalar specifying the number of equally spaced grid 
		points on each axis to use to specify the transformation.   
		Default is GRID = 3 (9 total grid points).     The value of
		GRID must always be greater than DEGREE + 1
	DEGREE - Integer Scalar specify the degree of the transformation.
		See the routine POLYWARP for more info.   Default = 1
		(linear transformation).
	CUBIC - if set and nonzero, then cubic interpolation is used (equivalent
		to INTERP = 2.   In IDL V5.0 or later, the CUBIC parameter can
		also be set to a value between -1 and 0 (see poly_2d for info).
 NOTES:
	(1) The 3 parameter calling sequence is less demanding on virtual 
		memory.
	(2) The astrometry in OLDHD will be precessed to match the equinox
		given in REFHD.

 EXAMPLE:
	Suppose one has an image array, IM, and an associated FITS header H.
	One desires to warp the image array so that it is aligned with another
	image with a FITS header, HREF.    Both headers contain astrometry info.
	Set pixel values to 0 where there is no overlap between the input and
	reference image, and use linear interpolation (default)

           IDL> hastrom, IM, H, HREF, MISSING = 0

 PROCEDURES USED:
	zparcheck, check_FITS, sxpar(), get_EQUINOX(), hprecess, extast,
	sxaddpar, sxaddhist, putast

 REVISION HISTORY:
	Written  W. Landsman, STX Co.              Feb, 1989
	Updated to CHECK_FITS                      Dec, 1991
	New astrometry keywords                    Mar, 1994
	Recognize GSSS header   W. Landsman        June, 1994
	Added CUBIC keyword     W. Landsman        March, 1997

 NAME:
	ICMK_HTML_HELP

 PURPOSE:
	Given a list of IDL procedure files (.PRO), VMS text library 
       files (.TLB), or directories that contain such files, this procedure 
       generates a file in the HTML format that contains the documentation 
       for those routines that contain a DOC_LIBRARY style documentation 
       template.  The output file is compatible with World Wide Web browsers.

 CATEGORY:
	Help, documentation.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	ICMK_HTML_HELP, Sources, Outfile

 INPUTS:
     Sources:  A string or string array containing the name(s) of the
		.pro or .tlb files (or the names of directories containing 
               such files) for which help is desired.  If a source file is 
               a VMS text library, it must include the .TLB file extension.  
               If a source file is an IDL procedure, it must include the .PRO
               file extension.  All other source files are assumed to be
               directories.
     Outfile:	The name of the output file which will be generated.

 KEYWORDS:
     TITLE:	If present, a string which supplies the name that
		should appear as the Document Title for the help.
     VERBOSE:	Normally, ICMK_HTML_HELP does its work silently.
		Setting this keyword to a non-zero value causes the procedure
		to issue informational messages that indicate what it
		is currently doing. !QUIET must be 0 for these messages
               to appear.
     STRICT:   If this keyword is set to a non-zero value, ICMK_HTML_HELP will 
               adhere strictly to the HTML format by scanning the 
               the document headers for characters that are reserved in 
               HTML (<,>,&,").  These are then converted to the appropriate 
               HTML syntax in the output file. By default, this keyword
               is set to zero (to allow for faster processing).

 COMMON BLOCKS:
	None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
	A help file with the name given by the Outfile argument is
	created.

 RESTRICTIONS:
	The following rules must be followed in formatting the .pro
	files that are to be searched.
		(a) The first line of the documentation block contains
		    only the characters ";+", starting in column 1.
               (b) There must be a line which contains the string "NAME:",
                   which is immediately followed by a line containing the
                   name of the procedure or function being described in
                   that documentation block.  If this NAME field is not
                   present, the name of the source file will be used.
		(c) The last line of the documentation block contains
		    only the characters ";-", starting in column 1.
		(d) Every other line in the documentation block contains
		    a ";" in column 1.

       Note that a single .pro file can contain multiple procedures and/or
       functions, each with their own documentation blocks. If it is desired
       to have "invisible" routines in a file, i.e. routines which are only
       for internal use and should not appear in the help file, simply leave
       out the ";+" and ";-" lines in the documentation block for those
       routines.

	No reformatting of the documentation is done.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       July 5, 1995, DD, RSI. Original version.
       July 13, 1995, Mark Rivers, University of Chicago. Added support for
               multiple source directories and multiple documentation
               headers per .pro file.
       July 17, 1995, DD, RSI. Added code to alphabetize the subjects;
               At the end of each description block in the HTML file,
               added a reference to the source .pro file.
       July 18, 1995, DD, RSI. Added STRICT keyword to handle angle brackets.
       July 19, 1995, DD, RSI. Updated STRICT to handle & and ".
               Changed calling sequence to accept .pro filenames, .tlb
               text librarie names, and/or directory names.
               Added code to set default subject to name of file if NAME
               field is not present in the doc header.
       Feb 17, 1998, Seb Oliver ICSTM, looks for the PURPOSE string and adds that

 NAME:
	OPLOTERR0
 PURPOSE:
	Over-plot data points with accompanying X or Y error bars.
	For use instead of PLOTERR when the plotting system has already been
	defined. 

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	oploterr0, [ x,]  y, [xerr], yerr  [,/NOHAT, HATLENGTH= ,
		 ERRTHICK= , ERRSTYLE=, ERRCOLOR = ]
 INPUTS:
	X = array of abcissae, any datatype except string
	Y = array of Y values, any datatype except string
	XERR = array of error bar values (along X)
       YERR = array of error bar values (along Y)

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
	NOHAT     = if specified and non-zero, the error bars are drawn
	            without hats.
	HATLENGTH = the length of the hat lines used to cap the error bars.
	            Defaults to !D.X_VSIZE / 100).
	ERRTHICK  = the thickness of the error bar lines.  Defaults to the
	            THICK plotting keyword.
	ERRSTYLE  = the line style to use when drawing the error bars.  Uses
	            the same codes as LINESTYLE.
	ERRCOLOR =  scalar integer (0 - !D.N_TABLE) specifying the color to
			use for the error bars

 NOTES:
       If only two parameters are input, they are taken as Y and YERR
       If only three parameters are input, they will be taken as X, Y and
       YERR respectively.

 EXAMPLE:
       Suppose one has X and Y vectors with associated errors XERR and YERR
	and that a plotting system has already been defined:

       (1) Overplot Y vs. X with both X and Y errors and no lines connecting
           the points
                  IDL> oploterr, x, y, xerr, yerr, psym=3
       (2) Like (1) but overplot only the Y errors bars and omits "hats"
                  IDL> oploterr, x, y, yerr, psym=3, /NOHAT

 PROCEDURE:
	A plot of X versus Y with error bars drawn from Y - YERR to Y + YERR
	and optionally from X - XERR to X + XERR is written to the output device

 NAME:
	OPLOTERR0
 PURPOSE:
	Over-plot data points with accompanying X or Y error bars.
	For use instead of PLOTERR when the plotting system has already been
	defined. 

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	oploterr0, [ x,]  y, [xerr], yerr  [,/NOHAT, HATLENGTH= ,
		 ERRTHICK= , ERRSTYLE=, ERRCOLOR = ]
 INPUTS:
	X = array of abcissae, any datatype except string
	Y = array of Y values, any datatype except string
	XERR = array of error bar values (along X)
       YERR = array of error bar values (along Y)

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
	NOHAT     = if specified and non-zero, the error bars are drawn
	            without hats.
	HATLENGTH = the length of the hat lines used to cap the error bars.
	            Defaults to !D.X_VSIZE / 100).
	ERRTHICK  = the thickness of the error bar lines.  Defaults to the
	            THICK plotting keyword.
	ERRSTYLE  = the line style to use when drawing the error bars.  Uses
	            the same codes as LINESTYLE.
	ERRCOLOR =  scalar integer (0 - !D.N_TABLE) specifying the color to
			use for the error bars

 NOTES:
       If only two parameters are input, they are taken as Y and YERR
       If only three parameters are input, they will be taken as X, Y and
       YERR respectively.

 EXAMPLE:
       Suppose one has X and Y vectors with associated errors XERR and YERR
	and that a plotting system has already been defined:

       (1) Overplot Y vs. X with both X and Y errors and no lines connecting
           the points
                  IDL> oploterr, x, y, xerr, yerr, psym=3
       (2) Like (1) but overplot only the Y errors bars and omits "hats"
                  IDL> oploterr, x, y, yerr, psym=3, /NOHAT

 PROCEDURE:
	A plot of X versus Y with error bars drawn from Y - YERR to Y + YERR
	and optionally from X - XERR to X + XERR is written to the output device

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
	Adapted from the most recent version of PLOTERR.  M. R. Greason,
		Hughes STX, 11 August 1992.
       Removed spurious keywords for IDL V3.0.0  W. Landsman Jan. 1993

 NAME:
      OPLOTERROR
 PURPOSE:
      Over-plot data points with accompanying X or Y error bars.
 EXPLANATION:
      For use instead of PLOTERROR when the plotting system has already been
      defined. 

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
      oploterror, [ x,]  y, [xerr], yerr  [,/NOHAT, HATLENGTH= ,
             ERRTHICK= , ERRSTYLE=, ERRCOLOR =, /LOBAR, /HIBAR ]
 INPUTS:
      X = array of abcissae, any datatype except string
      Y = array of Y values, any datatype except string
      XERR = array of error bar values (along X)
      YERR = array of error bar values (along Y)

 OPTIONAL INPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
      /NOHAT     = if specified and non-zero, the error bars are drawn
                  without hats.
      HATLENGTH = the length of the hat lines used to cap the error bars.
                  Defaults to !D.X_VSIZE / 100).
      ERRTHICK  = the thickness of the error bar lines.  Defaults to the
                  THICK plotting keyword.
      ERRSTYLE  = the line style to use when drawing the error bars.  Uses
                  the same codes as LINESTYLE.
      ERRCOLOR =  scalar integer (0 - !D.N_TABLE) specifying the color to
                  use for the error bars
      NSKIP = Positive Integer specifying the error bars to be plotted.   
            For example, if NSKIP = 2 then every other error bar is 
            plotted; if NSKIP=3 then every third error bar is plotted.   
            Default is to plot every error bar (NSKIP = 1)
      LOBAR = if specified and non-zero, will draw only the -ERR error bars.
      HIBAR = if specified and non-zero, will draw only the +ERR error bars.
                  If neither LOBAR or HIBAR are set _or_ if both are set,
                  you will get both error bars.  Just specify one if you
                  only want one set.

 NOTES:
       If only two parameters are input, they are taken as Y and YERR
       If only three parameters are input, they will be taken as X, Y and
       YERR respectively.

 EXAMPLE:
      Suppose one has X and Y vectors with associated errors XERR and YERR
      and that a plotting system has already been defined:

       (1) Overplot Y vs. X with both X and Y errors and no lines connecting
           the points
                  IDL> oploterror, x, y, xerr, yerr, psym=3

       (2) Like (1) but overplot only the Y errors bars and omits "hats"
                  IDL> oploterror, x, y, yerr, psym=3, /NOHAT

       (3) Like (2) but suppose one has a positive error vector YERR1, and 
               a negative error vector YERR2 (asymmetric error bars)
                  IDL> oploterror, x, y, yerr1, psym=3, /NOHAT,/HIBAR
                  IDL> oploterror, x, y, yerr2, psym=3, /NOHAT,/LOBAR

 PROCEDURE:
      A plot of X versus Y with error bars drawn from Y - YERR to Y + YERR
      and optionally from X - XERR to X + XERR is written to the output device

 WARNING:
      This an enhanced version of the procedure OPLOTERR in the standard RSI
      library.    It was renamed to OPLOTERROR in June 1998 in the IDL 
      Astronomy library.

 NAME:
       SRCOR
 PURPOSE:
       Correlate the source positions found on two lists.
 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       srcor,x1in,ylin,x2in,y2in,dcr,ind1,ind2
 INPUTS:
       x1in,y1in - First set of x and y coordinates.  The program
                   marches through this list element by element,
                   looking in list 2 for the closest match.  So, the program
	            will run faster if this is the shorter of the two lists.
	            Unless you use the option or magnitude keyword, there is
	            nothing to guarantee unique matches.  
       x2in,y2in - Second set of x and y coordinates.  This list is
                   searched in its entirety every time one element of list 1
                   is processed.
       dcr - Critical radius outside which correlations are rejected;
             but see 'option' below.
 OPTIONAL KEYWORD INPUT:
       option - Changes behavior of program and description of output
                lists slightly, as follows: 
       OPTION=0 or left out
             Same as older versions of SRCOR.  The closest match from list2
             is found for each element of list 1, but if the distance is
             greater than DCR, the match is thrown out.  Thus the index
             of that element within list 1 will not appear in the IND1 output
             array.
       OPTION=1
             Forces the output mapping to be one-to-one.  OPTION=0 results,
             in general, in a many-to-one mapping from list 1 to list 2.
             Under OPTION=1, a further processing step is performed to
             keep only the minimum-distance match, whenever an entry from
             list 1 appears more than once in the initial mapping.
       OPTION=2
             Same as OPTION=1, except the critical distance parameter DCR
             is ignored.  I.e., the closest object is retrieved from list 2
             for each object in list 1 WITHOUT a critical-radius criterion,
             then the clean-up of duplicates is done as under OPTION=1.
       magnitude
             An array of stellar magnitudes corresponding to x1in and y1in.  
             If this is supplied, then the brightest star from list 1
             within the selected distance of the star in list 2 is taken.
             The option keyword is ignored in this case.
	spherical
	      If SPHERICAL=1, it is assumed that the input arrays are in
	      celestial coordinates (RA and Dec), with x1in and x2in in
	      decimal hours and y1in and y2in in decimal degrees.  If
	      SPHERICAL=2 then it is assumed that the input arrays are in
	      longitude and latitude with x1in,x2in,y1in,y2in in decimal
	      degrees.  In both cases, the critial radius dcr is in
	      *arcseconds*.  Calculations of spherical distances are made
	      with the gcirc program.
 OUTPUTS:
       ind1 - index of matched stars in first list
       ind2 - index of matched stars in second list
 COMMON BLOCKS:
       none
 SIDE EFFECTS:
       none
 METHOD:
       See under keyword LEVEL above.

 NAME:
	SXPAR
 PURPOSE:
	Obtain the value of a parameter in a FITS or STSDAS header

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	result = SXPAR( Hdr, Name, [ Abort, COUNT=, COMMENT =  ])   

 INPUTS:
	Hdr =  FITS or STSDAS header array, (e.g. as returned by READFITS or 
		SXOPEN) string array, each element should have a length of 80
		characters	

	Name = String name of the parameter to return.   If Name is of 
		the form 'keyword*' then an array is returned containing 
		values of keywordN where N is an integer.  The value
		of keywordN will be placed in RESULT(N-1).  The data type 
		of RESULT will be the type of the first valid match of keywordN 
		found.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
	ABORT - string specifying that SXPAR should do a RETALL
		if a parameter is not found.  ABORT should contain
		a string to be printed if the keyword parameter is not found.
		If not supplied SXPAR will return with a negative
		!err if a keyword is not found.

 OPTIONAL OUTPUT KEYWORDS:
	COUNT - Optional keyword to return a value equal to the number of 
		parameters found by sxpar, integer scalar

	COMMENT - Array of comments associated with the returned values

 OUTPUTS:
	Function value = value of parameter in header.
		If parameter is double precision, floating, long or string,
		the result is of that type.  Apostrophes are stripped
		from strings.  If the parameter is logical, 1 is
		returned for T, and 0 is returned for F.
		If Name was of form 'keyword*' then a vector of values
		are returned.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
	!ERR is set to -1 if parameter not found, 0 for a scalar
	value returned.  If a vector is returned it is set to the
	number of keyword matches found.

	If a keyword occurs more than once in a header, a warning is given,
	and the first occurence is used.

 EXAMPLES:
	Given a FITS header, h, return the values of all the NAXISi values
	into a vector.    Then place the history records into a string vector.

	IDL> naxisi = sxpar( h ,'NAXIS*')         ; Extract NAXISi value
	IDL> history = sxpar( h, 'HISTORY' )      ; Extract HISTORY records

 PROCEDURE:
	The first 8 chacters of each element of Hdr are searched for a 
	match to Name.  The value from the last 20 characters is returned.  
	An error occurs if there is no parameter with the given name.
       
	If a numeric value has no decimal point it is returned as type
	LONG.   If it contains more than 8 numerals, or contains the 
	character 'D', then it is returned as type DOUBLE.  Otherwise
	it is returned as type FLOAT

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
	DMS, May, 1983, STPAR Written.
	D. Lindler Jan 90 added ABORT input parameter
	J. Isensee Jul,90 added COUNT keyword
	W. Thompson, Feb. 1992, added support for FITS complex values.
	W. Thompson, May 1992, corrected problem with HISTORY/COMMENT/blank
		keywords, and complex value error correction.
	W. Landsman, November 1994, fix case where NAME is an empty string 
	W. Landsman, March 1995,  Added COMMENT keyword, ability to read
		values longer than 20 character
	W. Landsman, July 1995, Removed /NOZERO from MAKE_ARRAY call
	S. Oliver, July 1997, allows for strings to not end in apostrophes

 NAME:
	TVLASER
 PURPOSE:
	Prints screen onto a Postscript laser printer.    TVLASER
       uses the logical name or environment variable PSLASER to check which 
       postscript printer to use.    Optionally, prints selected information
       from a FITS header.   Users will want to tailor this program to
       their particular computer environment.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:     
       TVLASER, [ HEADER = ,YSTART = ,XSTART = ,XDIM = ,YDIM = , /NOEIGHT
		   TITLE = ,	/PORTRAIT, /REVERSE, /SCALE, /COLOR, /ENCAP ]

 INPUTS: 
	None 

 OPTIONAL KEYWORD INPUT PARAMETERS: 
	HEADER         =  a FITS header string array to create labels
	TITLE          = Scalar string to be printed above image as the 
		 	 title of the picture.  
	XSTART, YSTART = lower left corner (default of (0,0))
	XDIM,YDIM    =   Number of pixels read (default taken from !d.x_size 
	                 and !d.y_size)
	NOEIGHT        = if set then only four bits sent to printer (saves 
	                 space and time)
	PORTRAIT       = if present and non-zero, the printer results will
	                 be in portrait format; otherwise, they will be in
	                 landscape format. If labels are requested, image 
                        will be in portrait mode, regardless
       REVERSE        = if present and non-zero, color table will be fliped,
                        so black and white are reversed.
       SCALE          = if present and non-zero, image will be bytscaled after
                        being read off the screen. 
	COLOR         = If present and non-zero, the IDL.PS file is written
			using color postscript.
       ENCAP	      = If present and non-zero, the IDL.PS file is written 
                       in encapsulated postscript for import into LaTeX 
                       documents.   Automatically sets /NOPRINT.
	NOPRINT       = If present and non-zero, the output is sent into the
			 file idl.ps, which is NOT deleted and is NOT sent to
			 the printer.
	NODELETE      = If present and non-zero, the idl.ps file is kept AND
			 is also sent to the printer
	FILENAME      = scalar string giving name of output postscript file.
			Default is idl.ps.   Automatically sets /NODELETE

 OUTPUTS:
	IMAGE = array  containing byte values of display

 SIDE EFFECTS: 
	By default an idl.ps file created and deleted in directory.  User 
	must have write privileges in the current directory.

 PROCEDURE:  
	Read display and then redisplay into a postscript file.   If a FITS
	header is supplied then the values of the OBJECT, TELESCOPE, EXPTIME,
	and IMAGE keywords are printed, and astrometry info is displayed
	if present

 EXAMPLE:
	Send the image displayed in the current window to the color postscript 
	printer.   Display annotation from the FITS header hdr, and save the 
	postscript file with the name 'm33.ps' and give a title 'M33 Nucleus'

	IDL> tvlaser,h=hdr,/COLOR, FILE = 'm33.ps', TIT = 'M33 Nucleus'

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:     
	Major rewrite from UIT version   W. Landsman   Dec 94
