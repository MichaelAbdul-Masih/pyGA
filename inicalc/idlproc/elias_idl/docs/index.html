ELAIS IDL Libraries </H1>

<p>Below are links to the Hypertext help facilities for IDL routines.
These routines were developed as part of the <a
href="astro.ic.ac.uk/elais">ELAIS</a> Project.

<p>Some of the more obscure routines have been removed.  It is quite
possible that routines that remain do not work without routines that
are have not been included.  If you find any such missing routines or
other problems, please email <a
href="mailto:S.Oliver@Sussex.ac.uk">S.Oliver@Sussex.ac.uk</a>

<p>Some routines are modifications of routines written by others, in
particular the <a href="">Astrolib library</a>.  Our routines may fix
bugs (some bugs that have since been fixed) or may give additional
functionality (which may be highly specific to our purposes), 
we hope that we have made this clear in the headers, and
hope we have not
infringed any copyrights!


<p> All code is supplied as is and comes with no guarentees. Although if
you find any bugs we would like to know (please email  <a
href="mailto:S.Oliver@Sussex.ac.uk">S.Oliver@Sussex.ac.uk</a>)





<p> A <a href="elais_idl.tar">tar file</a> of all these routines
is also available for export.
