New Releases

Version 8.3

after hundreds of tests the new release of FASTWIND can be downloaded. The
major improvements compared to older releases are

vers. 8.3   new data for background elements (ATOMDAT_NEW)
vers. 8.3.1 stable temperature correction scheme

If you already have the new atomic-data, please download at least the new
programs (-> newprog.tgz).

Otherwise, download the complete inicalc.tgz and update your programs.

I hope that this release will be valid for the next (two) years or so, with
the major exeption that there will be updates concerning clumping and some
specific items concerning the treatment of resonances in the cross-sections.

directory inicalc_v8.6 contains the last version of this distribution

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 9

Update to nlte v9.x and nlte_approx v6.x 

PLEASE READ THE docu.txt carefully; a lot of things have changed/improved

major changes:

frequency grid automatically adapted in dimes (as a function of atomic model)

suggested default value for ND = 51 (instead of 47), in order to
resolve photospheric/wind transition point (for IR calculations)
(see dimes.f90)

implementation of various clumping laws (see nlte.f90 subroutine clumping)

improved treatment of ionisation from excited levels
(new file inicalc/ATOMDAT_NEW/atomnl2_meta_v2.0 required)

background abundances now in file (inicalc/ATOMDAT_NEW/abundan_solar)
see docu.txt

couple of more output collected: 
most important: file ABUNDAN in model-catalogue, saves all info
clumping factor in OUT_TOT; new structure name: struct.fcl

dielectronic recombination correctly treated if opacity tables are used:
approach: convolution with gaussian of sufficient width

WHAT HAS TO BE DOWNLOADED?

To ensure that you have everything updated I suggest that you download
everything (also the idl-routines have changed)

directory inicalc_v9x contains the last version of this distribution

for your convenience, there is also a tgz version of this distro available

The only (longer) files which have not changed are ATOMDAT/nl3*
you might scipt these files when copying


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

still missing/to be updated soon:

solution of HeI singlet/triplet problem (cf. Najarro et al 2006, A&A)

influence of single elements on T-structure (sometimes, the NLTE-bump
is predicted as too large in very thin winds. Has an influence on few IR
lines)

dielectronic recombination in alternative treatment (accounting explicitely
for stabilizing lines)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 10.1/7.1

The code has been substantially updated. These updates can be controlled by
three options in the new module nlteopt (in nlte.f90). By default, these
options are set to true. Set them to false if you want to come back (almost)
to the old v9 (standard). Note, however, that there are also some minor
updates which affect the older versions, so that you will not obtain
*identical* (but very similar) models, occ-numbers and profiles.

Note that the new code needs roughly 30-50% more comp. time than before.


-- OPTSTARK = .TRUE. : Approximate Stark/Voigt broadening included in 
                       calculation of background-element fluxes.
		       This results in a reasonable representation of the
		       Lyman jump (not applied to the Balmer jump so far)
		       
-- OPTPHOTLINES = .TRUE.: correct radiative transfer treatment for the most
                       important the lines from background elements 
		       (instead of the previous Sobolev-solution). 
		       This avoids too strong overpopulation
		       of the upper levels and the corresponding T-bump
		       in the outer photosphere.

-- UPDATE_STRUCT = .TRUE.: one additional iteration (at IT approx 12) to
                       obtain realistic photospheric grad(lines), by using
		       the flux-mean (from the current NLTE opacities) instead
		       of the Rosseland mean. (proven: one iteration is enough)

-- OPTDR =.TRUE.       Di-electronic recombination included for the
                       background elements, following the treatmeant of
		       considering the stabilizing lines explicitely.
		       
		       The DR-treatment of the explicit elements is controlled
		       by the atomic *.dat file. Usually, we use the DR's as
		       included in the ionization cross sections (from the OP),
		       but alternatively also the 2nd method (explicit
                       stabilizing transitions) can be used if specified in 
		       the *.dat file.
		       
The major changes (w.r.t. A10HHe) affect the dwarfs in the range between 
30 to 35 kK, where the HeII lines become stronger due to a different T 
and ne structure. For supergiants and hot/cool objects, the differences 
with ALL previous versions are small. 

Regarding differences for explicit ions (e.g., Si), the same should be true, 
but has not been tested yet.


Further change: Experienced users might know that a change in abundance
of explicit metals can be easily and fast computed when the model
is restarted (ITLAST > 20), with changed abundance.
In previous versions, the metallic background has been kept constant, except
for the continuum of the explicit elements.

Now, if the abundance is changed by more than 20%, the metallic background
is consistently iterated, to account also for modified *line*-blocking
effects. Still, since the model now longer changes (the effects on T and rho
are discarded), and H/He are almost not affected, the convergence is fast,
and for such a restarted model only order of 15 iterations are required
(compared to a complete model, which needs 40 to 60 iterations)

>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
		       
FORMAL: up to 20 overlapping/non-overlapping transitions can be 
calculated now in one run (compared to 2 transitions before)

>---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Model-atoms provided
A10HHe as before, to be used with FORMAL_INPUT_A10HHe and LINES_Si.dat
A10HHeSi (old Si-model), to be used with FORMAL_INPUT_A10HHeSi and LINES_Si.dat
A10HHeN2345 (old N2, new N3-N5 models), to be used with FORMAL_INPUT_A10HHeN2345 
     and LINES_N2345.dat.
     Note: modifications might be required after first detailed comparisons
     with obs are done!
     Note also: so far, old NII model atom implented, since Norbert P. 
     is presently updating this model (actually, already done); will be 
     transfered in the future. Comparisons new vs old not so bad.
     
More notes on the new N-model can be found in N2345.txt     
     
In case, modify your Makefile!!!!

>---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't forget to change your abundance_solar file (ATOMDAT_NEW)!!!

Still default: abundan_solar = abundan_solar_new (old Grevesse et al. values)

copy abundan_solar_new to abundan_solar if you want to use the new Asplund
data

For the rest, see docu.txt and the description of the changes in the header
of nlte.f90 and nlte_approx.f90.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The new version v10.1/7.1 has been deeply tested for the
A10HHe and A10HHeN2345 version and Teff > 20 kK. 
Except for probable changes to finalize the N-model atom, 
everything should run reliably.

Regarding the Si-model (old and new), on the other hand, only few tests have
been performed. This is also true for Teff < 20kK. Please report problems to
Jo


Happy computing!
